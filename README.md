# Open Radar Datasets
Welcome to the github page for the "Open Radar Datasets", a part of the "Open Radar Initative. 
There are currently two datasets available;
- Ground Surveillance Dataset
- Assisted living dataset

## Ground Surveillance Dataset
A dataset in a "ground surveillance" setting. 
The dataset has been collected with a stationary radar and targets moving in front of the radar. 
The dataset has been collected using both collaborative and non-collaborative targets. 

To load and view some samples of the datasets:
